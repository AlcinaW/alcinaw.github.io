          <p>I was part of the Marketing team at Canada Computers &amp; Electronics from February 2016 to October 2017. My main responsibilities involved organizing and executing on branded landing pages and microsites that were booked by vendors, as well as supporting the team's graphic design needs. I worked closely with a French translator to ensure that designs created for promotions were effective in English and French. The pages were built for the Canada Computers live site using a combination of Adobe Creative Suite, HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, jQuery, and SQL queries.</p>

          <p>I also designed and set up the weekly HTML email blasts, and worked with the Product team to execute on new product launches and determine the effectiveness of front page promotions.</p>
